    <h1>Hello, I'm Peter Kopp</h1>
    <p>I'm a passionate photographer who enjoys the art, and specializes in nature and car photography. I am based out of Madison, Wisconsin, and have been doing photography for 3 years now.
  <br> I love photography because of the super creative things you can do with it, and the fact that I have the ability to capture a moment in time. I also play the trombone in my schools band, and work on my school yearbook as a editor.
